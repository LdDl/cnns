1. Cover core with tests
2. Move main.go from root to other destination
3. New layers and learning optimization
- Softmax layer;
- Maxout layer;
- Dropout layer;
- Optimization for learning;
- Bias;
4. Refactor code and rethink structure of library
5. Remove some legacy and experemintal code to other branches
6. Error types and wrapping them
7. Test cases for most of math functions
8. Padding for convolutional layer
9. Write theoretical documents on most of functions (on every would be even better)
10. New struct of examples folder (split it on different types of tasks for neural networks)

# CNNs #
CNNS (Convolutional Neural Networks) is a little package for developing simple neural networks, such as CNN (you don't say?) and MLP.

## It has been made only for studying purposes. Do not use it in production!
## Any PR's (new layers, learning optimizators, Excel-examples, bug-fixes) to improve this library will be appreciated.

## Features

- CNN (convolutional neural network)
- MLP (multilayer perceptron)

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple:
```go
go get github.com/LdDl/cnns
```

## Usage

Just look into [examples folder](examples)

For some people it is really hard to understand algorithms without step-by-step examples. So we provide some in xlsx-based files

## Support

If you have troubles or questions please [open an issue](https://github.com/LdDl/cnns/issues/new).

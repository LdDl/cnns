## Features

- CNN (convolutional neural network)
- MLP (multilayer perceptron)

## Theoretical

### MLP
@todo
### CNN
@todo

Step-by-step feedforward and backpropagation calculations are made in file of Excel format (xlsx) which can be obtained in root of this repository ([step_by_step_cnns.xlsx](https://github.com/LdDl/cnns/blob/master/step_by_step_cnns.xlsx)). You can check associated example[examples/conv.go](https://github.com/LdDl/cnns/blob/master/examples/conv.go) also.
## Installation

Installation is pretty simple:
```go
go get github.com/LdDl/cnns
```
